with special menu lay-out to support onepage component

# stop working on it, remove juli 2025
too much different from standard Joomla thus too many parts need to be copied to other places. Hard to keep working correct.

menuitems with #op# in note are displayed as bookmarks to sections in the onepagecomponent with the same menu.
